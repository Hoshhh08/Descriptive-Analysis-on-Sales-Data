Descriptive Analysis on Sales Data


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing descriptive analytics and data preprocessing on a Sales and Discounts dataset. The analysis is aimed at understanding the dataset through statistical measures, visualizations, and preparing it for machine learning tasks.

Contents:

Basic Statistics:
1)Calculation of mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
2)Interpretation of statistical measures to gain insights.

Data Visualization:
1)Histograms for analyzing the distribution of numerical variables.
2)Boxplots for identifying outliers and understanding the interquartile range.
3)Bar charts to examine the distribution of categorical variables.

Data Preprocessing:
Standardization:
1)Scaling numerical variables using z-score normalization for uniformity.

One-Hot Encoding:
1)Conversion of categorical variables into dummy variables for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

Objective:
1)The primary goal of this project is to:
2)Explore and summarize the dataset using descriptive analytics.
3)Visualize the relationships and distributions of variables.
4)Preprocess the data to make it ready for further machine learning applications.

Key Findings:
1)Numerical data distributions revealed patterns and outliers.
2)Categorical data analysis highlighted imbalances and common trends.
3)Preprocessing steps, including standardization and encoding, enhanced the dataset's compatibility with analytical models.
